# set up a git repository

## clone a repo! 

to work on a project using github you must **clone** the repository to your local system. this allows you to make changes and experiment with your code without affecting the code on the master branch and any changed you make that cause bugs can just be reverted on your computer.

so to clone this repo follow the link to [the frc-git-training](https://github.com/beranki/frc-git-training) repository and click the button that says **`<> Code`**. copy the link presented to you under the HTTPS section and then open git bash. in git bash, to clone a repo you should type `git clone <link>`

## navigating to the repo

use the command `cd <path where the repo is saved>`, or locate the folder with the name of the repository using your os' folder management system.

once in the right folder you can move on to the next activity: [branch-setup](/branch-setup/).
